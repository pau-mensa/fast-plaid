    <b>FastPlaid</b> - A High-Performance Engine for Multi-Vector Search
</div>

&nbsp;

## ⭐️ Overview

Traditional vector search relies on single, fixed-size embeddings (dense vectors) for documents and queries. While powerful, this approach can lose nuanced, token-level details.

- **Multi-vector search**, used in models like [ColBERT](https://github.com/lightonai/pylate) or [ColPali](https://github.com/illuin-tech/colpali), replaces a single document or image vector with a set of per-token vectors. This enables a "late interaction" mechanism, where fine-grained similarity is calculated term-by-term to boost retrieval accuracy.

- **Higher Accuracy:** By matching at a granular, token-level, FastPlaid captures subtle relevance that single-vector models simply miss.

- **PLAID:** stands for _Per-Token Late Interaction Dense Search_.

- **Blazing Performance**: Engineered in Rust and optimized for **GPUs**.

&nbsp;

## ⚡️ Quick Start

Get started with creating an index and performing a search in just a few lines of Python.

```python
import torch

from fast_plaid import search

fast_plaid = search.FastPlaid(index="index", device="cpu") # or "cuda" for GPU.
# Leave blank for auto-detect, including multi-GPU.
# On CPU, specifying device speeds up initialization.

embedding_dim = 128

# Index 100 documents, each with 300 tokens, each token is a 128-dim vector.
fast_plaid.create(
    documents_embeddings=[torch.randn(300, embedding_dim) for _ in range(100)]
)

# Search for 2 queries, each with 50 tokens, each token is a 128-dim vector
scores = fast_plaid.search(
    queries_embeddings=torch.randn(2, 50, embedding_dim),
    top_k=10,
)

print(scores)
```

The output will be a list of lists, where each inner list contains tuples of (document_index, similarity_score) for the top top_k results for each query:

```python
[
    [
        (20, 1334.55),
        (91, 1299.57),
        (59, 1285.78),
        (10, 1273.53),
        (62, 1267.96),
        (44, 1265.55),
        (15, 1264.42),
        (34, 1261.19),
        (19, 1261.05),
        (86, 1260.94),
    ],
    [
        (58, 1313.85),
        (75, 1313.82),
        (79, 1305.32),
        (61, 1304.45),
        (64, 1303.67),
        (68, 1302.98),
        (66, 1301.23),
        (65, 1299.78),
    ],
]
```

## 🗂️ Update an Index

```python
import torch

from fast_plaid import search

fast_plaid = search.FastPlaid(index="index") # Load an existing index

embedding_dim = 128

fast_plaid.update(
    documents_embeddings=[torch.randn(300, embedding_dim) for _ in range(100)]
)

scores = fast_plaid.search(
    queries_embeddings=torch.randn(2, 50, embedding_dim),
    top_k=10,
)

print(scores)
```

The **`.update()` method** efficiently adds new documents to an existing index while automatically maintaining centroid quality through a buffered expansion mechanism:

1. **Buffered Updates**: New documents are first accumulated in a buffer. When the buffer reaches the `buffer_size` threshold (default: 100 documents), the system triggers a centroid expansion check.

2. **Automatic Centroid Expansion**: During expansion, embeddings that are far from all existing centroids (outliers) are identified using a distance threshold computed during index creation. These outliers are then clustered using K-means to create new centroids, which are appended to the existing set.

3. **Efficient Small Updates**: For small batches of documents (below `buffer_size`), the update is performed immediately without centroid expansion, ensuring fast incremental updates.

This approach balances efficiency with accuracy: small updates are fast, while larger batches automatically adapt the index structure to accommodate new data distributions.

&nbsp;

## 🔎 Filtering

You can restrict your search to a specific subset of documents by using the `subset` parameter in the `.search()` method. This is useful for implementing metadata filtering or searching within a pre-defined collection.

The `subset` parameter accepts a list of IDs. These IDs correspond directly to the order of insertion, starting from 0. For example, if you index 100 documents with `.create()`, they will have IDs `0` through `99`. If you then add `50` more documents with `.update()`, they will be assigned the subsequent IDs `100` through `149`.

You can provide a single list of IDs to apply the same filter to all queries, or a list of lists to specify a different filter for each query.

```python
import torch
from fast_plaid import search


fast_plaid = search.FastPlaid(index="index") # Load an existing index

# Apply a single filter to all queries
# Search for the top 5 results only within documents [2, 5, 10, 15, 18]
scores = fast_plaid.search(
    queries_embeddings=torch.randn(2, 50, 128), # 2 queries
    top_k=5,
    subset=[2, 5, 10, 15, 18]
)

print(scores)

# Apply a different filter for each query
# Query 1: search within documents [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# Query 2: search within documents [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
scores = fast_plaid.search(
    queries_embeddings=torch.randn(2, 50, 128), # 2 queries
    top_k=5,
    subset=[
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
        [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
    ]
)

print(scores)
```

Providing a `subset` filter can significantly speed up the search process, especially when the subset is much smaller than the total number of indexed documents. In order to increase the recall when applying drastic filtering, consider increasing the `n_ivf_probe` parameter in the `.search()` method (default: 8). It controls the number of clusters to search within the index for each query. Only clusters that contain documents from the provided subset are considered during the search.

_All benchmarks were performed on an H100 GPU. It's important to note that PLAID relies on Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. This means the very first execution can exhibit longer runtimes. To ensure our performance analysis is representative, we've excluded these initial JIT-affected runs from the reported results. In contrast, FastPlaid does not employ JIT compilation, so its performance on the first run is directly indicative of its typical execution speed._

## 📖 FastPlaid Class

The **`FastPlaid` class** is the core component for building and querying multi-vector search indexes. It's designed for **high performance**, especially when leveraging GPUs.

### Initialization

To create an instance of `FastPlaid`, you'll provide the directory where your index will be stored and specify the device(s) for computation.

```python
class FastPlaid:
    def __init__(
        self,
        index: str,
        device: str | list[str] | None = None,
        low_memory: bool = True,
    ) -> None:
```

```
index: str
    The file path to the directory where your index will be saved or loaded from.

device: str | list[str] | None = None
    Specifies the device(s) to use for computation.
    - If None (default) and CUDA is available, it defaults to "cuda".
    - If CUDA is not available, it defaults to "cpu".
    - You should specify the device to accelerate the initialization of FastPlaid index especially when using CPUs.
    - Can be a single device string (e.g., "cuda:0" or "cpu").
    - Can be a list of device strings (e.g., ["cuda:0", "cuda:1"]).
    - If multiple GPUs are specified and available, multiprocessing is automatically set up for parallel execution.
      Remember to include your code within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block for proper multiprocessing behavior.

low_memory: bool = True
    If True, the index is loaded in a memory-efficient manner, keeping tensors on CPU and moving them to the target device only when needed. This reduces VRAM usage at the cost of some performance. No effect when device is "cpu".

```

### Creating an Index

The **`create` method** builds the multi-vector index from your document embeddings. It uses K-means clustering to organize your data for efficient retrieval.

```python
    def create(
        self,
        documents_embeddings: list[torch.Tensor] | torch.Tensor,
        kmeans_niters: int = 4,
        max_points_per_centroid: int = 256,
        nbits: int = 4,
        n_samples_kmeans: int | None = None,
        batch_size: int = 50_000,
        seed: int = 42,
        use_triton_kmeans: bool | None = None,
        metadata: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None,
    ) -> "FastPlaid":
```

```
documents_embeddings: list[torch.Tensor] | torch.Tensor
    A list where each element is a PyTorch tensor representing the multi-vector embedding for a single document.
    Each document's embedding should have a shape of `(num_tokens, embedding_dimension)`. Can also be a single tensor of shape `(num_documents, num_tokens, embedding_dimension)`.

kmeans_niters: int = 4 (optional)
    The number of iterations for the K-means algorithm used during index creation.
    This influences the quality of the initial centroid assignments.

max_points_per_centroid: int = 256 (optional)
    The maximum number of points (token embeddings) that can be assigned to a single centroid during K-means.
    This helps in balancing the clusters.

nbits: int = 4 (optional)
    The number of bits to use for product quantization.
    This parameter controls the compression of your embeddings, impacting both index size and search speed.
    Lower values mean more compression and potentially faster searches but can reduce accuracy.

n_samples_kmeans: int | None = None (optional)
    The number of samples to use for K-means clustering.
    If `None`, it defaults to a value based on the number of documents.
    This parameter can be adjusted to balance between speed, memory usage and
    clustering quality. If you have a large dataset, you might want to set this to a
    smaller value to speed up the indexing process and save some memory.

batch_size: int = 50_000 (optional)
    Batch size for processing embeddings during index creation.

seed: int = 42 (optional)
    Seed for the random number generator used in index creation.
    Setting this ensures reproducible results across multiple runs.

use_triton_kmeans: bool | None = None (optional)
    Whether to use the Triton-based K-means implementation.
    If `None`, it will be set to True if the device is not "cpu".
    Triton-based implementation can provide better performance on GPUs.
    Set to False to ensure perfectly reproducible results across runs.

metadata: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None (optional)
    An optional list of metadata dictionaries corresponding to each document being indexed.
    Each dictionary can contain arbitrary key-value pairs that you want to associate with the document.
    If provided, the length of this list must match the number of documents being indexed.
    The metadata will be stored in a SQLite database within the index directory for filtering during searches.
```

### Updating the Index

The **`update` method** provides an efficient way to add new documents to an existing index while automatically maintaining centroid quality. It uses a buffered expansion mechanism: documents are accumulated until reaching `buffer_size`, at which point embeddings far from existing centroids are identified and used to create new centroids that are appended to the index structure. This ensures the index adapts to new data distributions over time.

```python
    def update(
        self,
        documents_embeddings: list[torch.Tensor] | torch.Tensor,
        metadata: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None,
        batch_size: int = 50_000,
        kmeans_niters: int = 4,
        max_points_per_centroid: int = 256,
        n_samples_kmeans: int | None = None,
        seed: int = 42,
        start_from_scratch: int = 999,
        buffer_size: int = 100,
        use_triton_kmeans: bool | None = False,
    ) -> "FastPlaid":
```

```
documents_embeddings: list[torch.Tensor]
    A list where each element is a PyTorch tensor representing the multi-vector embedding for a single document.
    Each document's embedding should have a shape of `(num_tokens, embedding_dimension)`.
    This method will add these new embeddings to the existing index.

metadata: list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None
    An optional list of metadata dictionaries corresponding to each new document being added.
    Each dictionary can contain arbitrary key-value pairs that you want to associate with the document.
    If provided, the length of this list must match the number of new documents being added.
    The metadata will be stored in a SQLite database within the index directory for filtering during searches.

batch_size: int = 50_000 (optional)
    Batch size for processing embeddings during the update.

kmeans_niters: int = 4 (optional)
    The number of iterations for the K-means algorithm when creating new centroids during expansion.

max_points_per_centroid: int = 256 (optional)
    The maximum number of points per centroid when creating new centroids.

n_samples_kmeans: int | None = None (optional)
    The number of samples to use for K-means clustering during centroid expansion.
    If None, it defaults to a value based on the number of documents.

seed: int = 42 (optional)
    Seed for the random number generator used during centroid expansion.

start_from_scratch: int = 999 (optional)
    If the existing index has fewer documents than this threshold, the index will be
    completely rebuilt from scratch instead of being updated incrementally.

buffer_size: int = 100 (optional)
    Number of documents to accumulate before triggering centroid expansion.
    When the buffer reaches this size, outlier embeddings (far from existing centroids)
    are identified and clustered to create new centroids that are appended to the index.

use_triton_kmeans: bool | None = False (optional)
    Whether to use the Triton-based K-means implementation during centroid expansion.
```

### Searching the Index

The **`search` method** lets you query the created index with your query embeddings and retrieve the most relevant documents.

```python
    def search(
        self,
        queries_embeddings: torch.Tensor | list[torch.Tensor],
        top_k: int = 10,
        batch_size: int = 25_000,
        n_full_scores: int = 4096,
        n_ivf_probe: int = 8,
        show_progress: bool = True,
        subset: list[list[int]] | list[int] | None = None,
    ) -> list[list[tuple[int, float]]]:
```

```
queries_embeddings: torch.Tensor | list[torch.Tensor]
    A PyTorch tensor representing the multi-vector embeddings of your queries.
    Its shape should be `(num_queries, num_tokens_per_query, embedding_dimension)`.
    Can also be a list of tensors, each representing a separate query. All tensors in the list must have the same embedding dimension.

top_k: int = 10 (optional)
    The number of top-scoring documents to retrieve for each query.

batch_size: int = 25_000 (optional)
    The internal batch size used for processing queries.
    A larger batch size might improve throughput on powerful GPUs but can consume more memory.

n_full_scores: int = 4096 (optional)
    The number of candidate documents for which full (re-ranked) scores are computed.
    This is a crucial parameter for accuracy; higher values lead to more accurate results but increase computation.

n_ivf_probe: int = 8 (optional)
    The number of inverted file list "probes" to perform during the search.
    This parameter controls the number of clusters to search within the index for each query.
    Higher values improve recall but increase search time.

show_progress: bool = True (optional)
    If set to `True`, a progress bar will be displayed during the search operation.

subset: list[list[int]] | list[int] | None = None (optional)
    An optional list of lists of integers or a single list of integers. If provided, the search
    for each query will be restricted to the document IDs in the corresponding inner list.
    - If a single list is provided, the same filter will be applied to all queries.
    - If a list of lists is provided, each inner list corresponds to the filter for each query.
    - Document IDs correspond to the order of insertion, starting from 0.
```

### Deleting from the Index

The **`delete` method** allows to permanently remove embeddings from the index based on their insertion order IDs. If a metadata database exists, the corresponding entries will also be automatically removed. To update an existing embedding, you should delete it first and then add the new version with the `.update()` method. Warning, when using the `delete` method, the remaining documents are re-indexed to maintain a sequential order. If you delete document k, all documents with id > k will have their id decreased by 1.

```python
    def delete(
        self,
        subset: list[int],
    ) -> "FastPlaid":
```

```
subset: list[int]
    A list of embeddings IDs to delete from the index. The IDs are based on the original
    order of insertion, starting from 0. After deletion, the remaining documents are
    re-indexed to maintain a sequential order.
```

## 🗂️ Built-in SQLite Filtering

FastPlaid includes a lightweight, optional, built-in metadata filtering engine powered by SQLite. When you provide the metadata parameter during .create() or .update(), FastPlaid automatically stores this information in a searchable database within your index directory.

You can then use the fast_plaid.filtering.where() function to query this database using standard SQL conditions. This function returns a list of embeddings IDs that match your criteria, which you can pass directly to the subset parameter of the .search() method to pre-filter your search.

```python
from datetime import date

import torch
from fast_plaid import filtering, search

# 1. Initialize the FastPlaid index
fast_plaid = search.FastPlaid(index="metadata_index")
embedding_dim = 128

# 2. Create initial documents with metadata
initial_embeddings = [torch.randn(10, embedding_dim) for _ in range(3)]
initial_metadata = [
    {"name": "Alice", "category": "A", "join_date": date(2023, 5, 17)},
    {"name": "Bob", "category": "B", "join_date": date(2021, 6, 21)},
    {"name": "Alex", "category": "A", "join_date": date(2023, 8, 1)},
]

fast_plaid.create(documents_embeddings=initial_embeddings, metadata=initial_metadata)

# 3. Update the index with new documents and metadata
new_embeddings = [torch.randn(10, embedding_dim) for _ in range(2)]
new_metadata = [
    {"name": "Charlie", "category": "B", "join_date": date(2020, 3, 15)},
    {
        "name": "Amanda",
        "category": "A",
        "join_date": date(2024, 1, 10),
        "status": "active",
    },
]

fast_plaid.update(documents_embeddings=new_embeddings, metadata=new_metadata)

# 4. Use filtering.where to get the corresponding rows of the FastPlaid index
# which match the SQL condition
subset = filtering.where(
    index="metadata_index",
    condition="name LIKE ? AND join_date > ?",
    parameters=("A%", "2022-12-31"),
)

# 5. Perform a search restricted to the filtered subset
query_embedding = torch.randn(1, 5, embedding_dim)
scores = fast_plaid.search(queries_embeddings=query_embedding, top_k=3, subset=subset)

print("Search results within the subset:")
print(scores)

# 5. Access to the metadata of the retrieved documents
for match in scores:
    print("Metadata of matched documents:")
    print(filtering.get(index="metadata_index", subset=[subset for subset, _ in match]))
```

You can also rely on the existing subset parameter of the .search() method to filter candidates based
on the order of insertion or rely on an external filtering system as providing the metadata parameter is optional.

### List Fields (`where_any` / `where_all`)

If your metadata contains list or tuple values (e.g. a list of foreign IDs per document), FastPlaid automatically detects them and builds an in-memory inverted index for fast lookups. No API changes are needed at creation time — just pass lists as values:

```python
metadata = [
    {"name": "Alice", "foreign_ids": [2, 3, 4], "more_ids": [6, 7]},
    {"name": "Bob", "foreign_ids": [1, 2], "more_ids": [6, 9]},
    {"name": "Charlie", "foreign_ids": [3, 5]},
    {"name": "David", "foreign_ids": [3, 5], "more_ids": [9, 8]},
]

fast_plaid.create(documents_embeddings=embeddings, metadata=metadata)
```

Then query with `where_any` (OR — documents matching **any** of the values) or `where_all` (AND — documents matching **all** of the values):

```python
# Documents with foreign_id 2 OR 5
subset = filtering.where_any(index="my_index", field="foreign_ids", values=[2, 5])
# → [0, 1, 2]

# Documents with foreign_id 2 AND 3
subset = filtering.where_all(index="my_index", field="foreign_ids", values=[2, 3])
# → [0]
```

These can be combined with standard SQL filters via set operations:

```python
recent = filtering.where(index="my_index", condition="join_date > ?", parameters=("2024-01-01",))
by_foreign = filtering.where_any(index="my_index", field="foreign_ids", values=[3])
by_more = filtering.where_any(index="my_index", field="more_ids", values=[9])
subset = sorted(set(recent) & set(by_foreign) & set(by_more))

scores = fast_plaid.search(queries_embeddings=query, top_k=5, subset=subset)
```
